This project is a lightweight Streamlit application in Python that sends a structured prompt—consisting of a system prompt, contextual information, and a user question—to OpenRouter and renders the model’s streaming response live in the UI. Pydantic AI defines and validates input/output schemas to ensure robust prompt construction and predictable responses, while Streamlit provides a fast, interactive interface for entering prompts and viewing token-by-token results. The app communicates with OpenRouter using streaming for low-latency feedback, and integrates Langfuse for end-to-end observability, including prompt/response tracing, latency metrics, and evaluation hooks. The design favors clear functional components, typed models, and minimal state, making it easy to extend (e.g., swapping models, adding tools, or caching). With this stack, you get rapid prototyping speed, reliable data validation, and production-grade monitoring for iterative development and deployment.
